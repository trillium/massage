# Bring Trillium Massage to <PropertyName />!

After a long day of travel or sightseeing, your guests deserve to unwind. I offer professional, in-home massage therapy that brings the spa experience directly to your property—no driving required.

Both booking options work great. Booking directly is usually a bit cheaper, but there are times when [booking through Airbnb makes more sense](/blog/when-to-book-on-airbnb) (especially if they have a promo code!).

## Service location isn't <PropertyName />?

That's fine, my business is mobile and I'm happy to come to you if you'd rather book elsewhere, just update the location in the booking form and we'll chat about it!
