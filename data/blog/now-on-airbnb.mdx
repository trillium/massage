# Now on Airbnb!

After a decade of bringing mobile massage therapy to clients across LA, I've joined Airbnb's Services platform. If you're already using Airbnb or prefer booking everything in one place, you can now find me at:

[In-Home Massage by Trillium](https://airbnb.com/sv/trilliummassage)

## Why use Airbnb's platform?

One of the hardest parts of any small business is getting in front of people, especially in an industry like massage therapy where word of mouth is especially important. I've specialized in in-home massage since 2016, providing 2500+ sessions on the booking platform Soothe to date, but my reputation and reviews there aren't publicly visible—you need the app to see them.

Airbnb opens up their services platform to anyone searching online, whether they have the app or not, which means my track record and client reviews can actually help people find me. Plus, I can set my own rates and run my business the way I think is best, with full control over pricing, availability, and how I communicate with clients.

## Airbnb's commitment to professionalism

Airbnb's vetting is thorough—professional credentials, liability insurance, and identity verification are required. This creates a community of legitimate practitioners rather than a free-for-all, which protects both therapists and clients.

## Why this works for both of us

I've built my practice on transparency—clear pricing, no hidden fees, showing up on time with spa-level quality. Airbnb adds layers of support I can't provide alone: their customer service team, additional insurance coverage as a large company, payment protection, and policy enforcement. Airbnb opens another avenue to connect with people who are already thinking about comfort and relaxation, whether they're visiting LA or live here year-round.

The platform puts massage therapy in front of people who might not have considered in-home service before. By removing the usual barriers—driving, parking, unfamiliar environments—more people can access therapeutic work that helps with pain management, stress relief, and recovery.

## How it works

Airbnb handles payments, scheduling, and the communication platform, while I continue showing up to provide great massage service. Same quality of service, new avenue.

## Where should you book?

Either option works—booking [directly through my site](/booking) is slightly cheaper, but if you're traveling for work, bundling everything through Airbnb might make expense reports easier.

## Ready to try it?

If you're already comfortable with Airbnb or like having everything in one booking, this is an easy way to bring therapeutic massage to your space. Same expertise and equipment I've been using for years, now available through a platform you already trust.
