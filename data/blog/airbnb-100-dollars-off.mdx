# $100 Off Massage Through Airbnb (Ends Jan 1st!)

Happy holidays! 🎄

Airbnb is running a **\$100 off promo** on my massage services for purchases of **\$150 or more** from now until **end of day January 1st, 2025**. This is a great opportunity to book a session or **pre-purchase time that we can schedule for whenever works best for you**.

Don't worry about finding the perfect date right now. We can coordinate the actual session timing after you book.

**Don't see a time that works?** Just book any available slot within the promo window (by Jan 1st) and we'll reschedule for later. The key is getting it booked by the January 1st deadline. You can also split your session time into multiple shorter sessions if that works better for you.

## The Deal

- **Discount:** \$100 off purchases of \$150 or more
- **Booking Deadline:** Must be booked by end of day, January 1st, 2025
- **Session Timing:** Can be scheduled into January and beyond
- **Example:** 90-minute session normally \$180 → \$80 with promo
- **Best Value:** Longer sessions or multiple sessions to maximize your savings

## How to Book

**Important:** The promo code must be applied during checkout. It cannot be added after booking is complete. Make sure you see the discount applied before finalizing!

1. Go to my [Airbnb listing](https://airbnb.com/sv/trilliummassage)
2. Click **Show Dates**
3. Find an available time and click it
4. Continue to the checkout screen
5. Look for the "Coupon" or "Promo Code" section

**P.S.** Airbnb has many great service providers and experiences. I'd be honored if you supported them even if you don't want to book with me or massage isn't your thing.
