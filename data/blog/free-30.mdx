## What to Expect: Space Requirements

Trillium Massage is a mobile service, which means we bring everything to you — all we need is a little space to set up!

- **Setup Area**: Please allow for a clear space approximately **7 feet long by 4 feet wide** to comfortably fit the massage table and allow room to move around it.
- **Ideal Environment**: A quiet, low-traffic area works best. Soft lighting and minimal distractions help create the relaxing atmosphere you deserve.

## Why Is This Time Limited?

While we love offering these free 30-minute sessions, it's important to note that they are **time-limited** for a reason. As much as we'd love to offer free services all the time, we can't work for free indefinitely. These free slots pull from the availability of other paying clients, and balancing this with regular business operations is essential for sustainability.

If you're looking for wider availability and more flexible options, consider booking a **full one-hour** or **90-minute massage**. These sessions not only give you more time to relax and unwind, but they also allow for greater availability for future bookings, helping us better serve all of our clients.
