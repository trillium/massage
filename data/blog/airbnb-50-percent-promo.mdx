# 50% Off Massage Through Airbnb (Ends Dec 4th!)

Happy post-Turkey Day! 🦃

Quick heads up: Airbnb is running a **50% off promo** on my massage services from now until **end of day December 4th, 2025**. This cuts the cost in half. Save up to **\$200**, bringing your cost down to ~\$80/hr.

I'd be stoked if you took advantage of this to book a session, or even **pre-purchase time that we can schedule for whenever works better for you**. Don't worry about finding the perfect date right now. We can coordinate the actual session timing after you book.

**Don't see a time that works?** Just book any available slot within the promo window (by Dec 4th) and we'll reschedule for later. Sessions can be scheduled into December. The key is getting it booked by the Dec 4th deadline. You can also split those 2.5 hours into multiple shorter sessions if that works better for you.

**Prefer a shorter session?** The promo code works on other durations too. Check out the different service options on my listing. Just be advised, I don't know when a discount like this will come back around, so I recommend booking more time to save for later.

## The Deal

- **Promo Code:** `MERCI50`
- **Discount:** 50% off (up to \$200)
- **Booking Deadline:** Must be booked by end of day, December 4th, 2025
- **Session Timing:** Can be scheduled into December
- **Featured Service:** Thank You Offering (2.5 hours, normally \$400 → \$200 with promo)
- **Cost with promo:** ~\$80/hr

## How to Book

**Important:** The promo code must be applied during checkout. It cannot be added after booking is complete. Make sure you see the discount applied before finalizing!

**P.S.** Airbnb has many great service providers and experiences. I'd be honored if you supported them even if you don't want to book with me or massage isn't your thing.
