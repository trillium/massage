# 50% Off Massage Through Airbnb (Ends Dec 4th!)

Happy post-Turkey Day! 🦃

Quick heads up: Airbnb is running a **50% off promo** on my massage services from now until **end of day December 4th, 2025**. This cuts the cost of a 2.5-hour session in half—that's up to **$200 off**.

I'd be stoked if you took advantage of this to book a session, or even **pre-purchase time that we can schedule for whenever works better for you**. Don't worry about finding the perfect date right now—we can coordinate the actual session timing after you book.

**Don't see a time that works?** Just book any available slot within the promo window (by Dec 4th) and we'll reschedule for later. You can also split those 2.5 hours into multiple shorter sessions if that works better for you.

## The Deal

- **Promo Code:** `MERCI50`
- **Discount:** 50% off (up to $200)
- **Deadline:** End of day, December 4th, 2025
- **Service:** Thank You Offering (2.5 hours, normally $400)
