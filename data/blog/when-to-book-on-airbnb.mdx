# When Is It Better to Book on Airbnb?

Hey, you found me! I've got a pretty unique name, so finding me after seeing my listing in services like Soothe and Airbnb is pretty easy. Now that you’re here, you might be asking: should I book directly, or is there a reason to use Airbnb?

## You Want To Contribute to Airbnb's reviews/reputation

Each reviewer on my airbnb listing is verified through their site. I’ve saved my Soothe and attributed them in my [Reviews](/reviews) panel, but if you want to see them youself you'd have to download the Soothe app and find my lising. Quite a pain.

## You Need to Expense It

If you need to expense your trip and want a single invoice that covers multiple services or bookings, Airbnb makes this process straightforward. While I can provide an invoices for my services, Airbnb is often easier if you need everything bundled together on one receipt.”

## You Want to Take Advantage of Airbnb Promos

> [!NOTE]
> When there's an active promo I know about, I try to update my site to say so!

Sometimes Airbnb offers major ridiculously good promotions. When I first joined, they ran a [50% off deal](/blog/airbnb-50-percent-promo), so you could get \$400 worth of services for just \$200. As a small business, I simply can’t match discounts like that and still stay afloat. Airbnb, as a large company, can afford to cover those costs and still pay me my full service fee. In other words, when they offer coupons or promotions, they’re essentially subsidizing your session—you pay less, but I still receive my normal rate.

Since Airbnb takes a portion of my earnings, booking on their platform is generally pricier (\$150–\$160 per session versus \$140 here). However, if you have a coupon, it can still be worth it:

Occasionally, Airbnb’s discounts are so generous that you end up paying less than my standard rate, but I still receive my usual compensation for the session. When that happens, booking through Airbnb is a win-win.

## When Direct Booking Makes More Sense

In most cases, I recommend booking directly. It’s easier and usually saves you money. However, as mentioned earlier, a good Airbnb coupon can sometimes make their platform the better deal.
