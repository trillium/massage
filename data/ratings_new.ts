      "Very happy with the massage and Trillium. I had really sore muscles from working out and I feel so much better post his treatment. He's super friendly and setting up his massage table took no time. I'm sure this wasn't the last time to use his incredible services.",

      'Trillium was amazing — easygoing, professional, and incredibly knowledgeable. He was prompt and flexible with scheduling, which made the whole experience smooth and relaxed. The session itself was exceptional; he really knows his craft and creates a calm, comfortable atmosphere. Highly recommend him to anyone looking for a skilled and intuitive massage therapist.',
