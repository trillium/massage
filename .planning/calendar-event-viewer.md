Continued features needed

This should be a calendar event made by the system, so it should have all the data of a calendar event.

Get the location from the event if it exists

Create a booking URL that leads to a bookingSlug if the data exists in the event body, or /book if it does not

This booking URL should have the location parameters prefilled as URL params

# Planning Document: Calendar Event V## 4. Implementation Status ✅ COMPLETED

### ✅ Files Created:

2. `/app/event/[event_id]/page.tsx` - Dynamic route page for event viewing
3. `/app/event/[event_id]/not-found.tsx` - Custom 404 page for missing events

### ✅ Features Implemented:

- Dynamic route handling with Next.js 13+ App Router
- Google Calendar API integration using existing authentication
- Exact event ID matching logic
- Comprehensive event information display
- Console logging for debugging
- Error handling and user-friendly messages
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript support with proper types

---

## 5. Testing Instructions

### To test the implementation:

3. **Test the event viewer**:
   - Visit `/event/0117s3kla2l59ug6d41tl87q1u`

4. **Test error handling**:
   - Visit `/event/non-existent-id` to see the 404 page

### Expected Behavior:

- ✅ Valid event ID → Shows event details + debug JSON
- ✅ Invalid event ID → Shows custom 404 page
- ✅ API errors → Graceful error handling
- ✅ Console logs → Debug information in browser console

Create a page that fetches data from the calendar API. If the user provides an exact match for a calendar event ID, display relevant information about that calendar event.

This can be structured at the file `/app/event/[event_id]/page.tsx`

---

## 1. Requirements

- **API Integration**: Connect to the calendar API to fetch calendar events.
- **Exact Match Logic**: Check if the provided ID matches any event in the fetched data.
  - the event id is stored in the ur as a perimeter at the moment
- **Display Event Info**: If a match is found, display selected information about the event.
  - also display Jason data as a consol.log debug
- **Error Handling**: Show appropriate messages if no match is found or if there are API errors.

---

## 2. API Details ✅ COMPLETED

- **Endpoint**: `/api/events` - Internal API endpoint that fetches from Google Calendar API
- **Authentication**: Uses existing Google Calendar OAuth via `getAccessToken()` function
- **Response Structure**: Returns `{ success: boolean, events: GoogleCalendarV3Event[], count: number }`

---

## 3. Page Design ✅ COMPLETED

- **Calendar Event Viewer**: Page displays detailed event information with clean UI
- **Debug Section**: Raw JSON data displayed for debugging purposes
- **Error Handling**: Custom 404 page for non-existent events

---

## 4. Implementation Steps (Revised)

1. **Set Up Dynamic Route Page** ✅ COMPLETED
   - Create a new file at `/app/event/[event_id]/page.tsx` to handle dynamic event IDs from the URL.

2. **API Fetch Logic** ✅ COMPLETED
   - On page load, fetch all calendar events from the calendar API.
   - Extract the `event_id` from the URL parameters.
   - Search the fetched events for an exact match with the `event_id`.

3. **Display Logic** ✅ COMPLETED
   - If a matching event is found, render its details (e.g., title, date, description).
   - Also, display the full event JSON data for debugging (e.g., using JSON.stringy() (5)).

4. **Error Handling** ✅ COMPLETED
   - If no event matches the provided ID, display a user-friendly “Event not found” message.
   - Handle and display API errors gracefully.
