## Industry Patterns and Insights

### Pricing Trends

- **Solo practitioners** can expect to pay $20-$50/mo for basic booking + payments
- **Multi-provider businesses** typically pay $30-$100/mo base + $10-$20 per additional provider
- **Enterprise platforms** (Boulevard, Mindbody) start at $129-$176/mo and scale to $400-$600+
- **Marketplace commissions** are common: 20-30% of first visit for new clients acquired through the platform
- **Payment processing** typically runs 2.5-2.9% + $0.15-$0.30 per transaction

### Feature Gaps Across the Industry

1. **SOAP notes** are rare outside MassageBook -- most platforms ignore clinical documentation
2. **Two-way client messaging** is only emerging (Fresha 2026, Square Assistant)
3. **AI features** are nascent: GlossGenius AI Analyst, Vagaro AI receptionist, Square Assistant, StyleSeat Smart Pricing
4. **Independent branding** is limited on marketplace platforms (Soothe, Zeel, StyleSeat)
5. **Mobile parity** is a universal weakness -- almost every platform has a weaker mobile experience than desktop
6. **Transparent pricing** is rare -- most platforms have hidden fees, add-on costs, or marketplace commissions

### What Massage Therapists Specifically Need (vs. General Beauty/Wellness)

- SOAP notes and clinical documentation
- Health intake forms with condition/medication tracking
- Insurance billing support
- Pressure/technique preference tracking
- Session-specific notes (not just client-level)
- Longer appointment durations (60-120 min vs. 15-45 min for hair/nails)
- Room/table management (not chair-based)
- Draping and comfort preferences
